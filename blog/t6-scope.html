        <h3>What is scope</h3>

          <h5>How to understand scope in JavaScript</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          In Javascript, scope is a very important concept for building a complex system. We think of it as a primary school with multiple grades, and each grade also has many classes.
          Each student will have his or her name, grade and class, and each day the students will learn in their own class. In other words, students are organized according to different grades and classes.
          Like a school, scope is used to store the variables in Javascript. It is also include different levels, such as global scope, local scope, and nested scope. Different levels of variables are stored in different scopes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>How does scope work in JavaScript</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible that more than one student in a school called 'Jack'. If we only find a name, then it will be hard to find out which 'Jack' is the student we are looking for. But if we have the grade and class to which he belong, we will find him soom.
          This way is good solution to the duplicate name conflicts. Like the grade and class in a school, scope use the same way to resovle the conflicts among the variables. And the scope is also a upgraded solution, because variables within a scope are not visible 
          outside the scope. At the same time, scope allows to nest. A program can access the variables in the same scope and also can access the variables within the scope that contain the scope where the program was created.

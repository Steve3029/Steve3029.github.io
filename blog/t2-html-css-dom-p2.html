                <p>
                    Grid based design is a important tool to design the structure of the webpages. It used to think the layout of the webpages.
                    Normally, a page will be divided into rows each of which will be divided into 12 columns. The elements will be included in these columns.
                    Depending on needs, they can occupy 3 columns, 4 columns, 6 columns, or entire row.

                    <p>
                        Semantic structure is a type of description provided to both the browser and the developer. It use HTML tag to provide the information about 
                        the meanings, the application, and so on. However, it does not provide information about how the browser displays the page.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Today, more and more devices are used by people to access the Internet, such as desktop PC, laptop, tablet, and smart phone.
                        And these devices have different size screens. Responsive web pages will be able to detect screens of different sizes and then 
                        rebuild the layout of the page and resize the elements according to the size of the device's screen for optimal display.

                    The Bootstrap CSS framework is a fantastic tool. With this framework, developers need to do only the necessary works to make page has a great display.
                    I now only know a very small part of its features. I am looking forward to have a deeper understanding of it in the future study.

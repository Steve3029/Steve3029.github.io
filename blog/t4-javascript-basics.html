        <h3>JavaScript Learning</h3>
        <strong>21 Dec 2017</strong><br>
        <p>
          How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is used to create the contents and structures of the webpages, and the CSS is used to set the appearance and layout of the pages. JavaScript is used to implement the interactive features of webpages.
          JavaScript is a type of scripting language. It can be used not only to develop website, but also to implement any type of system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The control flow is similar to the daily decision we make every day. It excute different actions according to different conditions. For example, we may have many leisure options on weekends. We may choose specific 
          activities depending on weather. If it rains, we will go to cinema, otherwise we will go to the park. For this example, weather is a condition and going to the cinema or going to the park is a action. The control flow 
          of JavaScript perform the same function.

          The Loops allow developers to repeat a piece of code. Just like running, You will set up a distance like 5km. Then you will keep moving your legs until you reach the distance. The movement of your legs is like the piece code 
          that is repeatly executed. The distance is like the stop condition of the loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arrays can normally be accessed through bracket notation. It also has some built-in properties and methods, such as length property that can provide how many items the arrary contains, push method that can add a item at 
          the end of the array, shift method that can remove and return the first item of the array.

          Objeects can be look as a collection of propertie and values. People can access its property through dot operator or bracket notation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions is a basic structual unit. Repeatable operation (repeat-pattern) can be packaged as a function that could be repeat invoke, which saves developers a lot of time and 
          improves the efficiency of development.

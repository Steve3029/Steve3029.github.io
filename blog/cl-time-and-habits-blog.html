    <h1>Time management and habits develop</h1>
    
    <p>
      I have just read the materials about time management and habits develop. I have tried meditation and 25 minutes timebox. During the period, I find that there are many type of meditations in the world.
      I never knew before that meditation is able to affect our brains. My attention was easily to drift and I had to draw it back again and again.

    <p>
      After meditation and timebox I tried, I feel that my mind has been released, which makes me more relaxed and more easily to focus. This is a wonderful experience.
      I intend to start developing my meditative habits. On other hand, starting from small things is a great idea. I believe I can benefit from it.

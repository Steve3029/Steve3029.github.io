          <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          Three years age, I worked at a Chinese software company. At that time, a very young colleague worked with me. I do not remember what caused the contradiction between us. 
          The result is that we was not able to work together to accomplish a mission. One day, I asked him whether I could have lunch with him and I would buy lunch for him. In China, 
          it is easier to talk when people have their lunch or dinner. I do not remembered what we talked about, but I remember how I felt when I talked. Most of time, I was a listener. 
          I rarely presented my opinion when he was talking. I was just listening without bias and then I thought what he said. Through listening, I found the reason that led to the contradiction 
          between us. And then I first admitted what I was dong wrong. I also sincerely expressed my opinion. We eliminated the conflict and established a deep trust through a lunck.
        </p>

          <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          During this time, I studied at home alone. I plan to do empathic listening practice with my wife. I think she is the one I should most like to listen to. 
          But the Christmas and New Year are her busiest time. I guess I can do the practice with her later.

          <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          After I tried the loving kindness meditation, I found something interesting happen to me. I feel more relaxed, more satisfied, and more happy. I am easier to fall asleep. 
          I started to care about around people, like how he is today and why she does not feel well.

          <h5>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          When I worked for the former company, I participated a decision to decide whether a product should be re-develop. 
          My opinion: 
          The product must be re-developed. Because the current product could not meet the customer needs. Due to the movement of people, the maintenance was geting harder and harder, 
          and there are some issues that were hard to fix. The maintenance cost of the project was becoming higher and the market competitiveness was getting weaker.

          Another stuff opinion:
          We should continue maintenning the current product. There are technical risks to the development of new product. A significant number of users were using the current product, and 
          the maintenance fees paid by users was a major source of revenue for the company.

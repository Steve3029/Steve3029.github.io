        <h3>Meditation Process</h3>
        <strong>18 Dec 2017</strong><br>
        <p>
          How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild? 
        </p>
        <p>
          I rather consider the 'process over product' as a kind of work flow. It makes the design and build process very clear and orderly. I took the following process.
          <ol>
            <li>develop the layout of the page.</li>
            <li>convert the wireframe into semantic html.</li>
            <li>set up the style from big elements to small elements.</li>
            <li>improve and adjust details.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <P>
          What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
        </P>
        <P>
          Before, I thought meditation was a kind mysterious practice that could only be mastered by a few monks. I also thought meditators could absorb the energy of nature to become more powerful.
          I thought of the meditators as a kind of people who was very close to God.
        </P>
        <p>
          What new things have you learnt about meditation?
        </p>
        <p>
          I have know that meditation is just a kind of mental practice that everyone can take like physical practice. Through the meditation, people will become more healthy, happiness, and focused. 
          I have learned almost anything about how to do a meditate. If I want to meditate I whould create a intention, then follow my breath. When my attention wander away I should bring it 
          back gently. The good way to bring my attention back is ackownledge, experience without judging and reacting, if need to react, continue maintaining mindfulness, let it go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried the meditation instruction in the chapter 2. Actually, It is very hard to me that is to open my eyes slightly. I prefer to close my eyes. And ten minute is a little long to me.

        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <strong>5 Jan 2018</strong><br>
        <p>
          <h5>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          I used met a boss who actually was my boss's boss. He had a high professional level, but he never show off it. Whether my boss or I had any hardship at work, he always kinkly help us. 
          He was always willing to listen our opinions whenever a decision needed to be made. He was more like a trusted friend when not working.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          Be honest, I do not think I am a compassionate man and I do not have a lot of friends either. But I am sure If i can deliver goodness to others I must be happiness. 
          I gradually began to pay attention to my communication with other people and I could understand others more when I started to practice the goodness meditation. When others 
          encounter difficulties i prefer to help them.

          <h5>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not try the Tonglen meditation yet because I guess the Tonglen is beyond my ability. I do not think I am a compassionate people before. I started to learn how to be the one. 
          So I am trying the multiplying goodness meditation. Maybe I will try it three weeks later.

          <h5>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt deeply the two point in the SCARF model. If the week's mission is completely new to me I will become a little anxiety, because it is uncertainty. 
          If I run into problems, I will ask for help if I do not find the cause of the problem for more than half an hour. Most of time, I need to solve them by myself. 
          I will be stressful because I can not get others help. I now know the working mechanism of the brain is the case. 
        </p>

          <h5>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? </h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not have chance to have a difficult conversation yet. I am looking forward to practice the conversation skill in the future.

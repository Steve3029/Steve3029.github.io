    <h1>My first blog after joning EDA</h1>
  
        
        <p>BootCamp is a great way to learn a new skill. People come from different backgrounds. They can touch different cutures while learning programming, which makes the process of study fun.
        </p>
        <p>Through step by step task, people can learn everything they need from basic concepts to practical applications.</p>
        
        <p>The way people learned left a deep impression on me. It works like a real company. There is a clear workflow from assigning to submitting tasks.</p>
        
        <p>Although I have just joined the EDA. I do like here. Everyone are friendly and they are willing to help each other. I look forward myself to be able to make some contrubution.</p>
       
        <p>Of course, I am excited to join here, and I am also a little bit nervous. English is my second language and this made me worried whether I am able to communicate smoothly with other students.</p>

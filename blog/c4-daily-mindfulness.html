        <h3>Mindfulness Procatice 3</h3>
        <strong>22 Dec 2017</strong><br>
        <p>
          What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
        </p>
        <p>
          I could not find a person who could do the mindfulness conversation with me. I used the informal mindfulness conversation method to talk with my one of my friend and my wife. I would notice the information that I might 
          overlook before when I give my all attention to what my friend or my wife talking about. I would not listening with my own point of view. I just focus the conversation itself. Because I was relax, alert, and no-judging when 
          I was in conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan to take the first two methods, have a buddy and do less than you can, to sustain my practice. The first thing is that I have to find a buddy who is willing to do 
          mindfulness practice with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any other musings?
        </p>
        <p>
          I have learned from the book that every meditation master has an experience as a beginner. Beginners are like the babies learing to walk. At the beginning, I should discipline myself to do practice regularly. 
          All efforts will be rewarded in a few months.

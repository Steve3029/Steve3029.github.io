          1. What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A responsive site is a web site that is able to display correctly on different screen sizes. With the invention of tablet and smart phone, people no longer 
          use their desktops to visit websites, and more and more people use devices of different screen sizes, such as tablets and mobile phones, to access the Internet.
          Responsive websites can display pages on tables and mobile phones as well as desktops.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. What mobile first design is, and why it's important. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The mobile first design is keep the mobile in mind when people are designing their websites. It means that the page structure and style should be prioritized for mobile devices. 
          In the UK in 2017, the 42 percentage Internet access comes from smartphone. This measn that mobile is the most devices used to browse websites by people. Because of this, mobile first design is te skill that must be mastered by designers and web developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frameworks are development tools that are able to reduce duplication of development. They usually are CSS or js file including many specific functions that can be used by developers in their projects or products.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. What a wireframe is and why we use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a draft of a page design. It can be implemented by hand painting and some design tools. Designer are usualy use it to develop website draft. And they often choose hand painting because 
          it is easy to be modified. The following are some wireframe of mine.
        </p>
        <div class="container">
          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="">
          <strong>The wireframe of blog page for mobile</strong>
          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="">
          <strong>The wireframe of blog page for desktop</strong>
          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="">
          <strong>The wireframe of home page for desktop</strong>
          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="">
          <strong>The wireframe of home page for mobile</strong>
        </div>
        <p>
          5. The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, I did not encounter too much difficulty in implementing the wireframes. The only difficulty I encountered was to nest elements. When the level of nested too much, it will be easy to take wrong tag.

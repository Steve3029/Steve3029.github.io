        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <strong>23 Dec 2017</strong><br>
        <p>
          Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, So far I have not been blocked by a problem. This may be because I have a little bit experience in coding, or may be I am luckly. I will list topics here, and I will come back to supplement the 
          content of the topics when I encounter problems in the future.
          <ul>
            <li>What was the problem?</li>
            <li>What problem solving techniques did you use?</li>
            <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>
            <li>What did you learn?</li>
          </ul> 
          The following are the reflection topics:
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode</li>
            <li>Trying something</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
            <li>Reading error messages</li>
            <li>Console.logging</li>
            <li>Googling</li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Explain what the following functions do to a non-tech friend
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>.map()</strong><br>
          Map is a built-in method of Array. What this method do is like a chef. To propare a meal, a chef needs many vegetables and meat. He or she cooks every kind of 
          vegetable or meat according to the recipe. In the end, She or he turned the vegetables and meat into dishes for you. Map accepts an array and processes each of these items according to a provided function, 
          and it will return a new array containing the results of the processing to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>.filter()</strong><br>
          Filter is also a built-in method of Array. It works like a fishery inspector. A fishery inspector will check the size and quantity of the fish caught by anglers to ensure that 
          the size and quantity of the fish meet the legal requirements. Filter accepts an array as argument and tests each of these items according to a provided function and returns an array containing the result of passing the test.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>.reduce()</strong>
          Reduce is a built-in method of Array too. It works like a cashier. A cashier will accumulate the total amount of her on-duty, which is to add up each sum of customer consumption together. 
          Reduce will also accumulate all items of an array and return a single result.

        <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
        <p>
          It is too hard to read this book. This book is full of psychology and medicine theory and medical terminology. I am shocked by it. The first time I knew two things.
          The first is that the brain can be changed through training. The second is that emotional intelligence can also be cultivated. The emotional intelligence includes five domains, 
          self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Developing emotional intelligence will bring us the following benefits.

            <li class="list-group-item">Stellar Work Performance</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Outstanding Leardership</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">The Ability to Create the Conditions for Happiness</li>
          </ul>
          I am going to do meditation by two minutes as the begin of my training.

        <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
        <p>
          I didn't have much experience with my first attempt, but I can fell myself becoming more peaceful and able to focus more easily on my own.

        <h3>Motivation</h3>

          <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most of people, I believed that pleasure was the source of happiness. But I was not able to find something that could bring me sustainable pleasure. 
          At that time, I just thought maybe I had not found something that really brought me sustainable pleasure.  I never realized I needed passion and higher purpose. 
          I guess I could get my sustainable happiness by setting my higher purpose and putting passion into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>What are your core values?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. I make a living by creating value for others. The 'others' may be a individual, a organization, a country, or the world that we are living in.
          2. Creation can change the world. It will make human life better.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am sure that I need more time to think about it.
        </p>

          <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          I was ever pretty bad at sports. So one day, I decided to begin do running exercise. After three months, I completed my first ten km. I used this as my success experience in resilience meditation exercise. 
          And In a college entrance examination, I got a poor grades. It might affect my future studies. That time I was desperate. I used it as my failure experience in my resilience meditation exercise.

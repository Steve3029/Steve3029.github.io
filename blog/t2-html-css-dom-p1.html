            <p>
                The box model is a one of the most important concept in web developing and design. Every individual element of a web page is included in a box that consist of content, padding, border, and margin.
                The width of the element is not just its contents, but also the padding and border width of the box where it resides. And the margin will decide the distance to the next element.
